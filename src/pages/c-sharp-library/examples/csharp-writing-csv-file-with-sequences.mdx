title: Write CSV file with Sequences

import Link from '@components/Link.astro';
import * as csharpBuildMetaForCsvFileWithSequencesPage from './csharp-build-meta-for-csv-file-with-sequences.md';

This examples shows how a CSV file that is formatted with sequences, can be written using Meta from a Fielded Text Meta File.  It uses this <Link url={csharpBuildMetaForCsvFileWithSequencesPage.url} text="example Sequence Meta File" />.

## CSV File

The CSV File to be written is:

```text
1,Misty,45
1,Oscar,35
2,Buddy,0.5,35,False
2,Charlie,2,35,True,John,35.0
2,Max,0.5,35,False
3,Bubbles,Orange,Wen
3,Flash,Yellow,Crucian
```

## Console Application

```csharp
using Xilytix.FieldedText;

    class Program
    {
        static void Main(string[] args)
