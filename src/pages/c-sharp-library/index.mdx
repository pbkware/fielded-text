The Fielded Text C# class library allows you to read and write text files with tables of values (eg. CSV files) in the same way as you read from and write to a database table.

The format and structure of the data within the text file is defined by a small XML file called the Meta file.  Xilytix.FieldedText uses the Meta file to read from and write to the text file as if it were a database.  Typically you would use a [Fielded Text Editor](https://fieldedtext.org/software/#applications) to create these Meta XML files.

The format (schema) of this Meta XML file is specified by a standard defined at [https://fieldedtext.org](https://fieldedtext.org).  In addition to using these Meta XML files, Xilytix.FieldedText can also be used to create them.  These XML files can then also be used by any other software component/library which support this standard.  Refer to the [https://fieldedtext.org](https://fieldedtext.org) website for more information about this standard.

Xilytix.FieldedText can be used to parse or generate nearly any type of CSV and Fielded Text file.  This includes files which have:

* fields are separated by delimiters (eg CSV files).
* fields which are fixed length.
* fields that are quoted.
* fields that have new lines embedded in them.
* headings.
* substitutions
* lines with different sets of fields based on key fields.
